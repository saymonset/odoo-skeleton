For some processes, you need to know the volume of your stock transfers.
This could be useful for example to know the device to use to process
it. An other use case could be to know how many trucks you need to
deliver your products.

By default, the delivery module from Odoo will compute the transfer
weight. Unfortunately, it will not compute the volume. This module will
add the volume computation to the stock transfer and to the moves. This
information will be stored in the database and will be available on the
transfer and move form views.
