This module adds a stage field in the pickings form view to be able to
track the progress of the picking.

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module has been created to be able to track operations running on a
picking. We can consider that as a substate of the picking:

- By default, we have some states on a picking:

  - draft
  - waiting
  - confirmed
  - assigned
  - done
  - cancelled

- Using this module, we can add some substate to the picking:

  - ``stock.picking.state`` --> ``assigned``:

    - ``stock.picking.stage_id`` --> ``new order``
    - ``stock.picking.stage_id`` --> ``preparing``
    - ``stock.picking.stage_id`` --> ``processed``

This approach is more flexible than using only the ``state`` field of
the picking.
