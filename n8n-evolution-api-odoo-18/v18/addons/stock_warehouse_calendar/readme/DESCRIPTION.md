This module adds a Calendar to the Warehouse. This calendar can then
be used as the basis of the proper computation of start/end dates based on
lead times in this and other modules.

In this module, the calendar is used to compute the start dates
of stock moves and pickings generated from procurements,
taking lead times into account.
