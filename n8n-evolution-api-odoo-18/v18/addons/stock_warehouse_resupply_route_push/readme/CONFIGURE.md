1. With multi-warehouses and advances routes enabled, navigate to any warehouse.
2. Select some warehouse in the *Resupply from* field.
3. Mark the new option *Resupply from another Warehouse with Push Rules*.
4. Click *Regenerate inter warehouse routes*.

If you already had a previous route to resupply from another warehouse, it has been
now archived and substituted by the new one. The new route is automatically assigned
to the same products, product categories and warehouses as the previous one was.

Also, note that this will create next inter-warehouse deliveries using a new operation type
dedicated inter-warehouse deliveries (internal or external depending on the company of
the destination warehouse).
